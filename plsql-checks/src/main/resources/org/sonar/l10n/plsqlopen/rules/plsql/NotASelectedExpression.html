<p>
In a SELECT DISTINCT with an ORDER BY clause, if you specify a value in the ORDER BY that does not exists 
in the SELECT clause, Oracle will raise the exception <code>ORA-01791: not a SELECTed expression</code>. 
</p>

<p>See this example:</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT item.name
  FROM item
 ORDER BY item.group_id
</pre>

<p>
The <code>item.id</code> column is not in the SELECT clause, so Oracle will raise an ORA-01791. The corrected version can be: 
</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT item.name, item.group_id
  FROM item
 ORDER BY item.group_id
</pre>

<p>
If the column in SELECT clause has an alias, you also can use the alias in the ORDER BY clause:
</p>

<pre>
-- valid queries
SELECT DISTINCT item.name AS full_name
  FROM item
 ORDER BY item.name;
 
SELECT DISTINCT item.name AS full_name
  FROM item
 ORDER BY full_name;
</pre>

<p>
Be aware that until the version 11.2.0.4, Oracle accepted some incorrect values in ORDER BY, like:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(item.name) AS full_name, item.group_id
  FROM item
 ORDER BY item.name -- should be "UPPER(item.name)" or "full_name" 
</pre>

<p>
You should fix the queries to avoid compatibility issues with newer versions of the Oracle database.
