<p>
In a SELECT expression, the WHERE clause is executed before the ORDER BY clause. Consider this example:
</p>

<pre>
DECLARE
  CURSOR recent_users IS
    SELECT user.name,
           user.creation_date
      FROM user
     WHERE ROWNUM <= 5
     ORDER BY user.creation_date DESC;
BEGIN
  ...
</pre>

<p>
This query won't return the last 5 created users. The database will filter the users without any ordering and after, apply the ORDER BY clause. The corrected query is:
</p>

<pre>
DECLARE
  CURSOR recent_users IS
    SELECT name,
           creation_date
      FROM (SELECT user.name,
                   user.creation_date
              FROM user
             ORDER BY user.creation_date DESC)
     WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
BEGIN
  ...
</pre>
