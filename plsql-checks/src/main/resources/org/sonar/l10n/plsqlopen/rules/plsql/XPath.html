<p>This rule allows the definition of custom rules using XPath expressions.</p>
<p>Issues are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a single or list of AST nodes, then a line issue with the given message is created for each node</li>
  <li>a boolean, then a file issue with the given message is created only if the boolean is true</li>
  <li>anything else, no issue is created</li>
</ul>
